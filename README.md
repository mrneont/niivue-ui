# NiiVue UI
 
[NiiVue](https://github.com/niivue/niivue) is a WebGL 2.0 medical image viewer for web environments. This user interface (UI) project (NiiVue UI) is a reference implementation of how controls (sliders, buttons, inputs) can be used to interact with core NiiVue functions. 

This user interface extends NiiVue and allows user friendly interactions with medical images. We use React for our frontend framework, and React MUI for the material design controls.

# Contributing

All contributions are encouraged and welcomed. Feel free to update documentation, add features, fix bugs, or just ask questions on the [issue board](https://github.com/niivue/niivue-ui/issues). 

## Using Issues

**All** contributions should start as a new issue on the [NiiVue issue board](https://github.com/niivue/niivue-ui/issues). 

By starting a new issue for everything we ping everyone watching the project at the same time, and therefore alerting them to the feature, bug, or question. It also gives everyone a change to comment on new posts. 

## Things to consider

When adding features please keep in mind that we want NiiVue to work on all devices that support WebGL 2.0 (laptops, desktops, tablets, and phones). Therefore, please do your best to test features on as many devices as you have access to. 

When testing locally from other devices you can navigate to your development computer's local IP address (assuming your phone and computer are on the same local network) at the port specified in the URL printed to the terminal.

## Protected branches

The `main` branch is protected. This means that no one can commit to main directly. All edits must be merged in from forks or feature branches.
